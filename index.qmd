## SIPBSCompBiol

We are a computational biology research group in [SIPBS](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/strathclydeinstituteofpharmacybiomedicalsciences/) (the Strathclyde Institute for Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences) at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. We apply computational and mathematical approaches to better understand biology.

Our main areas of research are in microbiology, human health, and plant health, We have experience and work across a number of areas, including:

- genomics
- systems biology
- metabolic modelling
- software development
- biostatistics
- phylogenetics and phylogenomics

## Summer Internships and Placements

We have space to accommodate students for funded summer internships and placements. If you are interested in joining us to gain some computational biology, data analysis, or bioinformatics research experience, please contact Leighton by [email]({{< var admin.mailto >}}) to arrange a short chat.

**NOTE: we do not offer unfunded internships** as we believe people should be paid for their work. If you would like to arrange a chat, please contact Leighton as early as possible to give the best chance of acquiring funding.

Please see [this page](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/sipbs-internships/external_funding.html) for a list of some funding sources.
