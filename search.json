The PhD application process and interview is a chance for you to establish whether you will get on with me, the other supervisor(s) and the group(s). A PhD can be a major chunk of your life, and it’s important for you (and everyone else!) that it’s something you enjoy. The selection process is as much for you as the candidate to select your PhD environment as it is for supervisors to select their students.\nSome people just find it hard to work together, and that’s OK - it’s not a reflection on ability or anything else. If you have doubts at this stage, it’s better to air them or maybe act on them, than spend four years regretting the choice. If you want to come in to visit before making a decision, that’s great - we’ll be happy to host you (though we can’t pay for travel or accommodation). A visit may give you a much better idea of what environment to expect than an interview alone would."

Initially, the supervisor(s) will have greater knowledge of the subject area, and academic writing, than the student. By the end of the PhD you will be working quite independently, and you will know more about the topic than your supervisor(s).\nThe nature of supervision changes over the course of the PhD also. Initially, your work might be quite directed: your supervisor(s) might be describing what you should read, do, and holding frequent (maybe weekly) meetings with you to ensure you start off well and go in a productive initial direction. As the PhD progresses, you will gain greater independence, deciding your own direction more, and meetings - and direct guidance - will be less frequent. By the end of the PhD, the supervisor(s)’ role is likely to be principally guidance on thesis writing - by that stage, you will be mostly working independently.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nKearns & Gardiner “The care and maintenance of your adviser” (2011) Nature doi:10.1038/nj7331-570a"

You might want guidance on a specific part of your work (e.g. whether the logic of your argument is sound) and end up with a lot of advice on writing style that you did not want, and do not particularly care for.\nThe key to getting the kind of feedback you want - or need - is to be clear about what you want, when you ask. Please do be open about this, as it makes it easier for your supervisor(s) to know what they should be focusing on. They will appreciate this as they can focus their time to be most helpful, and time spent on feedback you won’t use is not wasted. It’s also good for you, because you don’t need to deal with criticism you didn’t want.\nIt is also important to state when you need the feedback. There may be a deadline for you to submit, and you will need to reserve time to attend to any criticism. This also gives the reviewer a chance to say whether they think they can deliver in time (and at what level). This respects both your time, and the time of the reviewer."

    "text": "Separating criticism of work from criticism of yourself\nOne of the great, and sometimes tragic, things about being a scientist is that we tend to associate ourselves intimately with our work. A positive aspect of this is that it helps us engage and dedicate ourselves to projects and problems that require a lot of personal investment and, when they are successful, we rightly celebrate our success as something personal.\nA negative side to this is that we often identify ourselves so closely with our work that we cannot distinguish criticism of the work from criticism of ourselves. This is natural, and happens to us all. But it is important that we remember a criticism of what we have done is not a criticism of who we are. This can be hard at first, but becomes easier over time.\nIt is useful to realise as early as possible that criticism of your work is not criticism of you as a person. Many prominent scientists have not yet made this leap, and write angry, bitter letters in response to reviewers when their papers and grants receive criticism. They do not set a good example. It is fine not to agree with the criticism you receive, but there are better ways to express this than with anger."

It might be their fault that your problem exists, and you might be right to be angry with them, but being obviously angry is a quick way to make people disengage.

    "text": "Computational biology may involve many unfamiliar concepts and skills\nMost of our summer and other project students come to our group with a background in biomedical science, but not in computing or maths - the core skills of computational biology. We do aim to make projects as accessible as possible for students coming from a more biological background, but it is impossible to avoid presenting challenging new concepts and skills as part of the project. We do aim to make these useful in a broader context, and hope that these challenges empower students to continue learning when they leave the group.\nAll the same, we are asking you as students to learn novel concepts and novel skills at the same time. This is additional cognitive load over and above the focus on developing practical skills within a familiar conceptual setting, as might be the case with a lab project. Rushing your project will overload your ability to learn, and may well lead to frustration, especially if you compare apparent progress to friends doing lab projects (always a doubtful activity).\nYour project should be challenging, and you should feel challenged, but the group is here to support you, and we are available for you to ask questions and get guidance. We want you to learn and do well."

    "text": "Be sure of the focus of each practical activity\nYour project will comprise a series of practical activities. These will likely have been chosen in such a way that they each answer smaller questions that, together, contribute to answering a larger overarching question. They will probably also have been chosen in a way that cuts out some of the “noise” of research, so that you can focus on developing a single concept or answering a single self-contained research question.\nYou are less likely to learn the skills and concepts for each of the smaller activities - and might even accidentally ask the wrong scientific question - if you do not understand what you are meant to be doing in that activity, and why. If the instructions or guidance for an activity are unclear, please ask your supervisor or a member of the group for guidance.\nSimilarly, it can help to understand the rationale for an activity if you know where it fits in answering the larger questions of the project. If you are unsure about where an activity fits, please ask your supervisor or a member of the group."

    "text": "Try to learn concepts first\nA research project is not like a lab practical: you are expected to learn independently, and your supervisor doesn’t know the answers any more than you do, so they won’t be able to give the same kind of positive confirmation about outcomes as you might expect from a teaching lab. But your supervisor, and other members of the group, should know how to ask the scientific questions that give you the answers. We can’t tell you that your answer is correct, but we can probably tell you if likely asked the right question in the right way.\nIn your project, these questions are likely to involve new concepts and new skills for you.\nTrying to learn new concepts and new skills is much harder than trying to learn either in isolation. Our brains have a limited capacity and it can quickly get overloaded if there is too much new information. If you understand the concepts behind the new techniques before you learn them, you will have a mental framework that supports and guides your research work. Without that understanding, you will be learning concepts and techniques at the same time, and it won’t go as well.\nYou may well learn concepts quickest if someone explains them to you in a way that resonates with your understanding or way of thinking. It is part of your supervisor’s role (supported by other members of the group) to explain the concepts associated with your project. If you don’t understand an explanation, it is important to say so, as an alternative explanation may work better for you. If you are having difficulty understanding a concept when explained by one member of the group, ask another group member - we each understand and explain ideas slightly differently, and it may be that one person’s way of thinking works for you better than others’."

There are often many options to choose, with a wide array of possible settings, and this can be intimidating and baffling. It can be hard to know what settings to choose (and many people never use any but the default settings).\nIf you understance the concepts of what you are doing, this can guide your understanding and choice of settings for a piece of software. If you know that setting X is best for long sequences, and setting Y best for short sequences - and that your work focuses on long sequences - you can choose the appropriate setting.\nIt is also a good idea to play with a new piece of software to see how changing settings can affect the way it works. Use a small dataset so the program runs quickly, and try changing the parameters or using different options. Some changes might alter the output greatly, some not at all. But you will gain a knowledge about the available options, and intuition about what settings matter.\nThe important thing is that by understanding the concept or the behaviour of the tool itself, you become familiar with it, and then your focus can be on the scientific question you’re asking, and you do not become overloaded with trying to learn about a particular tool at the same time."

You can be asked:\n\nAnything in your thesis\nAnything about work related to your thesis\nAnything about the field in general\nAnything about the papers you cite (or do not cite)\nTechnical questions to probe for evidence of understanding, independence and autonomy\n\nThis is not an examination you can easily revise for, but after four years’ work on your topic, you should certainly feel confident to answer those questions comfortably, and not be too intimidated by any questions.\n\nWhat does the examiner want to know?\nThe job of the external examiner is to satisfy themselves about the standard of your work, but they may have in mind to get answers to the following:\n\nIs this thesis and the reported research the student’s own work?\nIs the work original?\n\nWhat is the contribution to the community/field?\nWhat is the novelty of the work?\nIs the work of the same quality as that usually published in the field?\n\nIs there capacity for growth and development?\n\nIs there this capacity in the candidate?\nIs there this capacity in the work?\n\nWhat are the gaps in the student’s knowledge and understanding?\nWhat are the limits of the student’s knowledge and understanding?\nIs the student able to critically evaluate and reflect?\n\nCan they do this for their own work?\nCan they do this for the field in general?\n\nDoes the student display autonomy and independence?\n\nThese can’t be answered in only a few questions, which is why the viva takes so long.\n\n\nIs there anything I can do to prepare?\nRather than focusing on specifics of your thesis - which you should already be very familiar with - you may find it more useful to spend some time thinking about general topics like:\n\nWhat is in your thesis?\nWhat are the key contributions you have made to the topic?\n\nWhere does your work fit in the broader context of the field?\n\nWhy did you make the choices you did, in your research approach?\n\nWhat assumptions did you make?\nWhat alternative approaches could you have taken?\nWhat are the limitations and weaknesses of your work?\n\nWhat future directions would you take the work in?\n\nWhich questions remain to be answered\n\n\nThis may help the viva take more of the form of a conversation than an adversarial question and answer session.\nThe best thing you can do is simulate the viva with a mock viva. Usually, your supervisor(s) will offer this without waiting for you to ask. It’s the only way to get experience of being face-to-face with someone asking questions about and discussing your thesis in depth, without doing the viva proper. If you don’t want to do this with your supervisor(s), you can still do it with a friend or colleague, and provide them with questions to ask. As Jill Stuart notes:\n\nFrankly, the content of the questions, whether or not I had written them myself, and how she responded to them didn’t matter—I just needed to be face to face with someone speaking about my thesis. […] After Karen asked me the first question, I think I blushed, giggled, said “ummmm” several times, and then stumbled through an answer, repeatedly saying, “no wait…” or “I wouldn’t say that…” or “let me start over…” or plain old “sh**!” But after about 20 minutes I began talking through my answers. My words started to flow, and I started to get used to the sound of my own voice giving answers. If I hadn’t done that with Karen, I think maybe I would have done it in my viva. Which would not have been good!"
